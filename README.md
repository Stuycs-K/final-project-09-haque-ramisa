## Overview
This program serves to demonstrate RSA encryption. The encryption and decryption algorithms are implemented such that when the program is run, a public key is generated and will be used to encrypt the inputted data. The corresponding private key is also generated and will be used to decrypt the data. The encrypted data, decrypted data, and keys are all displayed as standard output.

## Instructions
To use the program is fairly simple.

The user must type: `make go ARGS="<arg0 arg1>"` where arg0 can be **string** or **file**, and arg1 can be **plaintext** or a **file-path** respectively.
