# Work Log

## Ramisa

### 05/22

Looked further into RSA encryption to decide the extent of my intentions.

### 05/23

Wrote a program that implements RSA encryption using built-in methods to get a better idea of next steps.

### 05/28

Notes on RSA for presentation, written in PRESENTATION.MD

### 05/29

Implementation of encryption and decryption algorithms (individual class).

### 05/30
Code consolidated into key-generating, encode, and decode classes. Makefile created, not yet finalized.

### 05/31
Working on using the generated keys to encrypt and decrypt/.

### 06/03
Implemented the mathematical calculations to encrypt and decrypt input of both string and file types. Have makefile, but not yet completely up to date with methods.

### 06/04
Turned encoder and decoder into object types to consolidate code, all controlled by a new class (Main.class). Will eventually have the makefile interact with the Main class to make it more user-friendly.
